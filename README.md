## ✨ What is InsightDeck?

**InsightDeck** is an automation engine that converts  
**structured operational data (CSV)** into a **polished, executive-ready PowerPoint deck**.

It eliminates the most painful part of analytics work:

> *Turning correct data into credible slides — every single week.*

Instead of copy-pasting charts, fixing layouts, and rewriting summaries at midnight,  
InsightDeck produces **decision-grade slides** in seconds.

---

## 🎯 Why this matters

Dashboards already exist.  
Executives still ask for **slides**.

Slides are:
- portable
- narrative-driven
- meeting-native
- decision-oriented

InsightDeck bridges the gap between:
- **analytics systems** (accurate, but raw)
- **leadership expectations** (clear, visual, concise)

This is the **last mile of analytics automation**.

---

## 🧠 What InsightDeck actually does

### 1️⃣ Data ingestion
Accepts a structured CSV containing operational metrics such as:
- cost
- usage
- incidents
- SLA performance
- service dimensions

The input is validated and normalised before any output is generated.

---

### 2️⃣ KPI synthesis
Computes executive KPIs automatically:
- total cost
- total usage
- average SLA
- incident volume
- trend deltas

All KPIs are **presentation-safe** — formatted, scaled, and consistent.

---

### 3️⃣ Visualisation (auto-fitted)
Generates:
- clean trend charts
- consistent spacing
- readable labels
- no overflow, no clipping

Every chart is rendered **server-side** and fitted into a fixed layout grid.

---

### 4️⃣ Executive narrative
Builds a second slide focused on **decision support**, not data:

- Key insights  
- Key risks  
- Recommended actions  
- Method notes (for credibility)

Text length is capped.  
Font sizes auto-adjust.  
Nothing spills outside its container.
